We are currently using `json-server` as a mock server to run the project against.

In order to get up and running you will need to install `json-server`, you can do this form the command-line using:

```
npm install -g json-server
```

and can spin up the server by navigating to:
`/shared/src`

and then running the line below to spin up the server locally:

```
json-server --watch db.json
```
